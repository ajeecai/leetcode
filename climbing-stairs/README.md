## Takeaway

I could not resolve regular expression matching issue correctly, [here](../regular-expression-matching/regular-expression-matching-notworking.ts). This not working solution absolutely shoud be given up since it follows the straitfowarding thinking with lots of if -else which must be failed.

I could not think of a new idea then take a glance at the internet, it looks like many existing solutions say using dynamic programming. So this climbing-stairs is a simple practice for [dynamic programming](https://www.zhihu.com/question/39948290) learning (the explanation of the guy from bytedance is better), it is so awesome.

To my understand, no matter bottom-to-top or top-to-bottom, The key feature of DP is to store each intermediate state for the convienence to cal the other states in the future.

In the later solutions, I would learn more great algrithoms to solve issues rather than straightforward or loops-only solutions.

- [Divide and conquer](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/488384476)a good [example](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/merge-sort/a/divide-and-conquer-algorithms)

PS. the solution to this issue is in fact Fibonacci sequence.
